# LeetCode Practice Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This repository is dedicated to solving LeetCode problems and storing my solutions. It serves as a personal workspace for practicing coding, algorithms, and data structures.

## Repository Structure

- **Each Problem**: Each LeetCode problem has its directory with a unique name that corresponds to the problem's identifier on LeetCode.
  
## Usage

- **Solutions**: In each problem directory, you can find my solutions in Java language.
- **Test Cases**: I include test cases to validate the correctness of my solutions.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute your solutions, optimizations, or additional test cases by creating pull requests. Contributions are welcome!

## Resources

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): The official LeetCode website where you can find and practice coding problems.

Happy coding!
